In this repository, will be showed how to detect and remove outliers from your data, using pandas and numpy in python.

## IQR score 
Wikipedia Definition
The interquartile range (IQR), also called the midspread or middle 50%, or technically H-spread, is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles, IQR = Q3 âˆ’ Q1.In other words, the IQR is the first quartile subtracted from the third quartile; these quartiles can be clearly seen on a box plot on the data.It is a measure of the dispersion similar to standard deviation or variance, but is much more robust against outliers.
